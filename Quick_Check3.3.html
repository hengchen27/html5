<li><strong>Answer question number 1:</strong> The differance between relative positioning and absolute positioning. Relative positioning is used to nudge an element out of its normal position in the
document flow. Under relative positioning, the top, right, bottom, and left properties
indicate the extra space that is placed alongside the element as it is shifted into a new
position. Absolute positioning places an element at specific coordinates within a container
where the top property indicates the position of the elementâ€™s top edge, the right
property sets the position of the right edge, the bottom property sets the bottom edge
position, and the left property sets the position of the left edge.</li>
<li><strong>Answer question number 2:</strong>  
aside element {
position: absolute;
top: 10%;
left: 5%;
}</li>
