   Answer to question 1:
   <p> Relative positioning is used to nudge an element out of its normal position in the document flow. Under relative positioning, the top, right, bottom, and left properties indicate the extra space that is placed alongside the element as it is shifted into a new position. Absolute positioning places an element at specific coordinates within a container where the top property indicates the position of the element's top edge, the right property sets the position of the right edge, the bottom property sets the bottom edge position, and the left property sets the position of the left edge.</p>
   </li>
